# Universal remote Analog/Digital Input-Output Block for PC

This master’s thesis presents the design and implementation of a universal analog and digital input-output block for a PC. As part of the project, a device was created that enables remote measurements and signal generation, as well as the transmission of measurement results to the user via standard communication interfaces. The thesis describes the applied converters, techniques for communication with peripherals, key software components, and the method of controlling the device’s operation. Calibration and experiments were also conducted, confirming the functionality and correctness of the constructed pro totype. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the obtained results and proposals for further development of the project.
